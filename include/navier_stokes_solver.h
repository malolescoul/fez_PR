/**
 * A base class for Navier-Stokes solvers.
 *
 * This class handles the common tasks to all Navier-Stokes related solvers,
 * namely :
 *
 *  - creating and handling the mesh (fixed and/or moving)
 *  - creating the system parallel matrix and vectors
 *  - creating the mesh- and NS-related boundary conditions (constraints)
 *  - advancing the time integration and solving the nonlinear system
 *  - computing errors on velocity, pressure and mesh position, if applicable
 *
 * Solver-specific tasks (additional boundary conditions, outputting results,
 * computing errors, etc.) are handled by overloading the "solver_specific"
 * routines, which by default do nothing in this base class.
 * Other functions, such as setup_dofs, are marked virtual to allow overloading
 * by solvers requiring a specific treatment, but not all solvers are required
 * to overload these functions.
 *
 * This class does *not* handle the following, which must then be
 * implemented by each derived solver:
 *
 * - creation of the FiniteElements (e.g., FESystem or FECollection), which
 *   depend on the fields layout and specificities of each solver
 * - matrix and rhs assembly
 *   FIXME: This means that currently, each solver assembles its whole set of
 *   equations. In particular, the Navier-Stokes eq. are duplicated across the
 *   solvers, which is not ideal.
 *
